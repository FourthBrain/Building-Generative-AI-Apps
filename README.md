# <h1 align="center" id="heading">:wave: Welcome to the Building Generative AI Applications Workshop!</h1>

## ☑️ Objectives
By the end of this course you will: 
- [ ] Learn how prompt engineering and fine-tuning should be used together to optimize the output of large pre-trained models
- [ ] Fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) or text-to-image diffusion model using a data-centric approach
- [ ] Deploy your very own Generative AI application to Hugging Face :hugs:


## 🏗️ Project-Based Learning
During this course, you will build, ship, and share your own end-to-end Generative AI application.  Each individual/team will be judged on their application’s uniqueness, fine-tuning creativity, user experience, and by a single piece of content generated by their AI application.  The winner(s) of the workshop’s competition will be announced at the next Deeplearning.ai + FourthBrain event!
